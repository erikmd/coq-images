# Coq images

This repository gathers definitions of (unofficial)
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images for various versions of the
[Coq](https://github.com/coq/coq) proof assistant as well as of the
[MathComp](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp) library.

These images are based on [Debian 9](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/)
and are especially intended to be used for Docker-based CI tests of
Coq libraries.
